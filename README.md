### Goals
Our manuscript reports a further analysis of the phenomenon of quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) linked 
to persistent summer extreme weather events in the Northern Hemisphere. We compare results of high emission 
scenarios from CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate projections, using a previously developed fingerprint-based semi-empirical 
approach to project future occurrence of QRA events based on a QRA index derived from the zonally averaged surface temperature field.
